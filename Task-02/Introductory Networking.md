# 🔎 Introductory Researching — TryHackMe (Summary)

This TryHackMe module introduces the fundamentals of cybersecurity research skills used in penetration testing, focusing on how to efficiently find technical information, interpret security data, and use common tools and resources.

## 🧠 Core Concept of Research in Pentesting

Pentesting requires strong research skills to identify vulnerabilities, understand systems, and interpret technical outputs. Instead of memorizing everything, security professionals rely on documentation, tools, and public vulnerability databases such as CVEs.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Practical Knowledge

Several common tools and concepts are introduced:

- **Burp Suite Repeater**: Used to manually resend and modify HTTP requests for testing web applications.
- **Netcat (nc)**: A flexible networking tool used for listening on ports or sending manual network requests.
- **SCP**: Securely copies files between systems.
- **fdisk**: Used for viewing and managing disk partitions in Linux.
- **nano**: Simple text editor with options like backup creation.

These tools are essential for both system administration and penetration testing workflows.

## 🔐 Password Hashing & Formats

Understanding password storage formats is important for security analysis:

- **NTLM**: Hash format used by modern Windows systems.
- **SHA512crypt**: Common Unix-based password hashing format (identified by `$6$` prefix).

---

## 🧾 Vulnerability Research (CVE System)

The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system is used to track publicly known vulnerabilities.

Examples include:
- **CVE-2020-10385** → WPForms XSS vulnerability
- **CVE-2016-1240** → Apache Tomcat privilege escalation
- **CVE-2007-0017** → First VLC media player vulnerability
- **CVE-2019-18634** → sudo buffer overflow vulnerability

These identifiers allow security researchers to quickly reference and analyze known security issues.

---

## 🧩 Linux & Command-Line Basics

Common command-line concepts include:

- **cron jobs**: Scheduled tasks in Linux systems
- **fdisk -l**: Lists disk partitions
- **scp -r**: Copies entire directories
- **nano -b**: Opens file with backup enabled
- **nc -l -p 12345**: Starts Netcat in listening mode on port 12345

These commands are frequently used in system administration and penetration testing environments.

---

## 📊 Key Takeaway

The most important skill in this module is **efficient research**:
- Knowing what to search
- Understanding vulnerability references (CVE)
- Using tools effectively
- Interpreting system and security information

Penetration testing is less about memorization and more about knowing where and how to find the right information quickly.
